# Campaign website strategy

Our primary goal is to build a large and strong movement that is able to exercise enough power to bring about systemic change. Our digital infrastructure, which includes our campaign website, is set of tools that helps us achieve that goal.

More specifically, our campaign website helps us to do the following at scale:

- üí∂ **Crowdfund**: We're raising funds to support our movement with paid staff by providing the oppertunity to be an active part of our movement by making a financial contribution.
- üí¨ **Change narratives**: We‚Äôre making systemic issues √°nd the solutions tangible by telling personal and emotional stories, both online as well as during our IRL encounters. These stories serve as a means for people to become more socially engaged in our movement.
- üì± **Meet people where they're at**: We're moving people into action by first meeting people where they're at with low barrier online actions, whether that is signing a petition, participating in a quiz, etc.
- ‚ù§Ô∏è **Build strong relationships between change-makers**: We're increasing social engagement by bringing together people who are (geographically) close to each other and by providing them with opportunities to participate in bonding experiences. This process of community building is what gets people actively involved (e.g. giving money, volunteering), and it‚Äôs what ensures people stay actively involved (even when things get tough).
- üëë **Develop leadership**: We're building strong and scalable groups that get things done by giving our change-makers the tools, frameworks and support to learn how to organize themselves. By providing easily replicable tactics to participate in, we give new change-makers low-barrier ways to become familiar with our movement. At the same time, we develop leadership by trusting our change-makers with vital responsibilities.
- üí™ **Build people power**: We're building people power by making decisions together as movement members, by taking action with large numbers of people and by drawing attention to our message through creative actions.
