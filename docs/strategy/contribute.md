## Page goals

The primary goal of this page is to get new people involved with our movement. This is the first step towards becoming an active volunteer.

- The CTAs offered are low-barrier, to lure new people in that are just browsing around. People are not expected to make any kind of big commitment yet. Rather, we're asking them to _participate_ (non-active role): join a video call to 'learn more about us', join a Signal group to 'stay updated'.
- At the same time, the CTAs are meaningful steps towards becoming actively involved. We know that people who participate in these CTAs are much more likely to become active volunteers later on.
