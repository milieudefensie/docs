# General design principles

## Consistent design language

We want to make use of a consistent design language.

- Primary color: #ffa300 (orange)
- Secondary color: #9a49e2 (purple)
- Tertiary color: #69be28 (green)

## Ease of use

- We want to make it as easy as possible to manage the website content as an admin.

## Accessibility

The design should be accessible and well-optimized for most types of people and devices.

## Loading speed

Fast loading speeds

## Nudging

By placing certain content and links in certain places, we can nudge people to take certain actions. Actions that change-makers can take which have a high strategic value for us, should be placed on prominent positions on our website.

### Navigation position values

Where 1 is the least value (fewer people click these items), and 5 is the most value (more people click these items):

- Primary buttons: 5/5
- Secondary nav items: 4/5
- Tertiary nav items: 3/5
- Footer items: 2/5
- On-page links: 1/5

### Page position values

Where 1 is the least value (fewer people see this section of the page), and 5 is the most value (more people see this section of the page):

- Top section: 5/5 (most people, as this is where the page is loaded)
- Middle section: going down 4/5, 3/5, 2/5, 1/5 (the more people need to scroll, the less people see it)
- Bottom section: 4/5 (many people scroll straight down to the bottom of the page)
