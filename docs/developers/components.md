# Reusable components

The campaign website is built using reusable Vue components. This helps us create a consistent look and feel across the website.

All components are styled using Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI, which allows for easy customization and theming: just change the Tailwind CSS variables to change the look and feel of the entire website (colors, fonts, design elements).
