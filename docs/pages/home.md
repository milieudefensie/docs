### 1. Primary signup form

::: info
🇳🇱 **Heading**: "Sluit je aan"

⭐️ **Page position**: 5/5
:::

The primary signup form is the first step in our onboarding process. For many organic visitors, it is the first thing people see on our website, and it is the first thing they interact with.

It is very low-barrier. People are not making any commitments yet, besides wanting to stay in the loop. It is also very general and targets a broad audience. It is not a signup form for a specific campaign. Rather, it is for signing up for the movement as a whole.

This form signals to people visiting our website that they can become part of our movement. It is a way to get people to take the first step in their journey towards becoming a change-maker.

#### Types of users

- People who want a quick and easy way to **stay in the loop**
- People who want to become part of our **community**
- People who want to learn more about how to **contribute**

#### Follow up

After signing up, people will receive a series of emails to onboard them into our movement. They are motivated to join one of Signal chats, so that our local groups can give them a welcome call. They are also encouraged to join one of our events, so that they meet other change-makers in their area. Adittionally, they are invited to confirm their commitment to our movement by making a donation. Besides clear call to actions, we use the email ladder to increase social engagement by telling emotional and personal stories.
