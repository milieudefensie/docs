## Types of users

- People who are browsing around and want to know more about Milieudefensie.
- People who are looking for a local community to join.
- People who want to do something about the climate crisis and are looking for a way to get involved.
- People who want to join local events and actions.
- People who want to organize people in their area (hosting events/actions, welcoming new members, etc.).

Potential concerns that visitors might have:

- Too disruptive (don't identify as an 'activist')
- Too many new people (social anxiety)
- People are not like me (not relatable)
- Not enough time to commit (busy with work, family, etc.)
- Not sure how to get started (lack of knowledge, skills, etc.)
- Not sure if I can make a difference (doubt about impact)

## Goals

- **People join a local group.**

  - People to get in touch with other change-makers in their area (in particular their local group organizer)
  - Join Signal announcement chat, so we can keep them informed about upcoming events and actions (and potentially join the group chat for more active people after being integrated)
  - People join an event (and potentially become an active member after that, e.g. by hosting an event)

- **People start a new local group.**

## Tactics

- **[Social proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_proof)**
  - Testemonials from local groups members
    - Video (short, engaging, authentic, relatable) of local group members talking about their experiences
    - Text quotes from local group members
  - Total number and number of new change-makers
- **Proximity**
  - Automatically show relevant local groups based on user location (IP address) - also reduces [choice overload](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overchoice)
  - Show upcoming events in the user's area
- Show diversity in identity and activities to participate in
- Show that people are well able to contribute within their abilities and time constraints, by showing examples of small contributions and providing support
