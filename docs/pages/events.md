Goals:

- We want to show users events are in close proximity (in time, geographically, and in regards to identity & interests): close by location, in the near future, and relevant for them, because we know this optimizes the chances of them actually joining an event
- We want to give most visual attention to events that are relevant to the largest user cohort, to nudge this user cohort to sign up to those events. Most people visiting our calendar page are people who have never visited one of our events before.
- Users should not feel overwhelmed by choices (too many different events), because we know this optimizes the chances of them actually joining an event.

## Types of users

- People who are just browsing around and want to **learn more about our movement**
- People looking to do something **fun** and **social** (meet other like-minded people)
- People who want to **get involved** in our movement
- People who want to **organize something**, for example a local event or travel-together.
