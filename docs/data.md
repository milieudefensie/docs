# Data & tests

On this page, we will document the results of our campaign website, as a benchmark for evaluating new features and to be used by other organizations.

## Understanding the data

The data below is collected using Google Analytics 4. The following things are important to take into account when reading the data:

- The ratio of people accepting the cookie banner influences the conversion rates. People who do not accept the cookie banner are monitored using [advanced consent mode](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/10000067?hl=en) (without cookies, using data modeling). People who accept cookies may be more likely to convert. The kind of cookie banner you use may influence the acceptance rate.
- The traffic sources highly influence the conversion rates. For example, people who come from a paid social media post or single issue e-mail are usually much more likely to convert than people who come from a search engine. If you want to compare conversion rates, make sure to compare apple-to-apple traffic sources.
